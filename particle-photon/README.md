Here are the very old files I used to get running on the Particle Photon. Note the WS node file is very old and should not be used.




Note: This package.json will not work since the ws file needs to be the very old

    "ws": "0.4.32"
   
   
   However github has a problem with the above so does not allow it in the repo.
