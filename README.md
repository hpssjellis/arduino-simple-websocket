How to connect an Arduino to a node js websocket for fast webpage to aRDUINO COMMUNICATION.



DRAFT Feb 11th, 2020. Not yet working.

The basic files should eventually be

index.js   // loads the nodejs program to activate the socket. I have had it work using http://repl.it but want to get it working with Gitpod

index.html is loaded by index.js


socket.ino is loaded on your arduino. It will need the URL from the above index.html file when it is active.
